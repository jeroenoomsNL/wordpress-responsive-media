Wordpress plugin for responsive embedded media (oEmbed) like Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr, Kickstarter, Slideshare, Soundcloud, Speakerdeck, TED & Vine.

== Description ==

This Wordpress plugin makes embedded media responsive.

To embed a video or another object into a Wordpress post or page, place its URL into the content area.
Make sure the URL is on its own line and not hyperlinked (clickable when viewing the post).

WordPress will automatically turn the URL into a YouTube embed and provide a live preview in the visual editor.
Read more information about supported platforms and alternative implementations at [Wordpress.org](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds).
